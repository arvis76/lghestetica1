                <h6>What is Pressotherapy?</h6>
                <p>
                    Pressotherapy is a non-invasive treatment that uses pneumatic pressure massage to stimulate the lymphatic system, enhance circulation, and remove excess fluid and waste products from the body. Using a special suit with inflatable air chambers that fill and deflate in sequence, it creates a gentle compression that provides both aesthetic and health benefits.
                    This soothing and effective treatment is ideal for body contouring, swelling, cellulite, and tired legs, and is often used as a complement to other aesthetic treatments

                <h6>What is Pressotherapy Used For?</h6>
                <p>
                    Pressotherapy is perfect for:<br/>
                    ✅ Swollen legs and fluid retention (edema)<br />
                    ✅ Poor lymphatic circulation and a feeling of heaviness<br />
                    ✅ Cellulite and uneven skin texture<br />
                    ✅ Complementary treatment after fat reduction procedures (cavitation, RF)<br />
                    ✅ Boosting recovery after exercise or long periods of sitting<br />
                    ✅ Supporting the body’s natural detoxification process<br />
                </p>
                <h6>Key Benefits of Pressotherapy</h6>
                <p>
                    ✨ Activates the lymphatic system and reduces fluid retention<br />
                    ✨ Promotes detoxification and elimination of waste products<br />
                    ✨ Helps reduce body circumference and improve body contours<br />
                    ✨ Relieves muscle tension and promotes relaxation<br />
                    ✨ Soothes tired, heavy, or swollen legs<br />
                    ✨ Perfect to combine with other treatments for enhanced results<br />
                </p>
                <h6>How Does the Treatment Work?</h6>
                <p>
                    You wear a special compression suit that covers your legs, hips, and sometimes your arms or abdomen. Through cyclic inflation and deflation of the air chambers, a sequential massage is created that follows the body’s lymphatic flow.
                    The treatment feels like a gentle, rhythmic massage, and it is completely painless and deeply relaxing. Many clients even fall asleep during the session!
                </p>
