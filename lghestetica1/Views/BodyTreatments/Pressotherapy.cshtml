                    <h6>What is Pressotherapy?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Pressotherapy is a non-invasive treatment that uses pneumatic pressure massage to stimulate the lymphatic system, enhance circulation, and remove excess fluid and waste products from the body. Using a special suit with inflatable air chambers that fill and deflate in sequence, it creates a gentle compression that provides both aesthetic and health benefits.
                        This soothing and effective treatment is ideal for body contouring, swelling, cellulite, and tired legs, and is often used as a complement to other aesthetic treatments

                    <h6>What is Pressotherapy Used For?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Pressotherapy is perfect for:
                        ✅ Swollen legs and fluid retention (edema)
                        ✅ Poor lymphatic circulation and a feeling of heaviness
                        ✅ Cellulite and uneven skin texture
                        ✅ Complementary treatment after fat reduction procedures (cavitation, RF)
                        ✅ Boosting recovery after exercise or long periods of sitting
                        ✅ Supporting the body’s natural detoxification process
                    </p>
                    <h6>Key Benefits of Pressotherapy</h6>
                    <p>
                        ✨ Activates the lymphatic system and reduces fluid retention<br/>
                        ✨ Promotes detoxification and elimination of waste products<br />
                        ✨ Helps reduce body circumference and improve body contours<br />
                        ✨ Relieves muscle tension and promotes relaxation<br />
                        ✨ Soothes tired, heavy, or swollen legs<br />
                        ✨ Perfect to combine with other treatments for enhanced results<br />
                    </p>
                    <h6>How Does the Treatment Work?</h6>
                    <p>
                        You wear a special compression suit that covers your legs, hips, and sometimes your arms or abdomen. Through cyclic inflation and deflation of the air chambers, a sequential massage is created that follows the body’s lymphatic flow.
                        The treatment feels like a gentle, rhythmic massage, and it is completely painless and deeply relaxing. Many clients even fall asleep during the session!
                    </p>
                    <h6>Recommended Treatment Plan</h6>
