            <h6>What is the Combined Anti-Cellulite Treatment?</h6>
            <p>
                The Combined Anti-Cellulite Treatment uses a blend of advanced technologies that work synergistically to reduce cellulite, improve circulation, eliminate localized fat, and tone the skin. By combining Cavitation, Vacuum Therapy, Radiofrequency, and Pressotherapy, this treatment aims to fight “orange peel” skin and leave the skin smoother, firmer, and rejuvenated.
            </p>

            <h6>What Does the Treatment Involve?</h6>
            <p>
                <h6 class="antictxt">1. Cavitation:<br /></h6>
                Cavitation is a non-invasive procedure that uses ultrasonic waves to destroy fat cells in specific areas of the body. These cells are broken down and naturally eliminated through the lymphatic system, resulting in a significant reduction of localized fat.<br />

                <h6 class="antictxt">2. Vacuum Therapy:<br /></h6>
                Vacuum Therapy uses a suction system to stimulate blood circulation and improve lymphatic drainage. In addition to helping reduce cellulite, it also promotes tissue oxygenation, enhancing skin appearance.<br />

                <h6 class="antictxt">3. Radiofrequency (RF):<br /></h6>
                Radiofrequency is a technology that uses electromagnetic waves to penetrate the deeper layers of the skin, stimulating collagen production and reducing sagging. This step is ideal for firming the skin and improving elasticity, resulting in more toned and firmer skin.<br />

                <h6 class="antictxt">4. Pressotherapy:<br /></h6>
                Pressotherapy is a treatment that uses pneumatic pressure to activate lymphatic drainage and improve circulation. This helps eliminate toxins and fluid retention, reducing inflammation and improving the appearance of cellulite-prone skin.<br />
            </p>

            <h6>Benefits of the Combined Anti-Cellulite Treatment</h6>
            <p>
                ✨ Visible reduction of cellulite<br />
                ✨ Reduction of localized fat<br />
                ✨ Improved lymphatic drainage and toxin elimination<br />
                ✨ Firmer, more toned, and rejuvenated skin<br />
                ✨ Improved blood circulation and reduced fluid retention<br />
                ✨ Smoother and more even skin appearance<br />
                ✨ Non-invasive treatment with no recovery time<br />
            </p>

            <h6>How Does the Treatment Work?</h6>
            <p>
                1. Cavitation: Cavitation is first applied to areas with fat accumulation. Ultrasonic waves break down fat cells, which are then naturally eliminated by the body.<br />
                2. Vacuum Therapy: Next, vacuum therapy helps improve circulation and reduce cellulite through controlled suction, enhancing lymphatic drainage and skin oxygenation.<br />
                3. Radiofrequency: Radiofrequency is applied to tone the skin and improve its elasticity. Deep tissue stimulation enhances firmness and combats sagging.<br />
                4. Pressotherapy: Finally, pressotherapy is used to eliminate toxins and improve fluid drainage, reducing inflammation and promoting smoother, firmer skin.<br />
            </p>

            <h6>Recommended Treatment Plan</h6>
            <p>
                ⚡ Number of sessions: 6 to 10 sessions for optimal results<br />
                ⚡ Frequency: 1 to 2 times per week<br />
                ⚡ Maintenance: Monthly sessions for lasting results<br />
                ⚡ Tip: Stay well hydrated before and after the treatment to maximize results and support toxin drainage<br />
