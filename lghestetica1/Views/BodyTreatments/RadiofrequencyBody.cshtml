                <h6>What is Radiofrequency for the Body?</h6>
                <p>Radiofrequency for the Body (RF) is a non-invasive aesthetic treatment that uses electromagnetic waves to heat the deeper layers of the skin (dermis and subdermal tissue). This controlled heat stimulates the natural production of collagen and elastin, boosts circulation and lymphatic drainage, and helps to tighten the skin, reduce cellulite, and reshape body contours safely and gradually.</p>
                <h6>What is RF Body Treatment Used For?</h6>
                <p>

                    ✅ Postpartum or post-weight loss skin firming<br />

                <h6>Benefits of Radiofrequency for the Body</h6>
                <p>
                    ✨ Stimulates collagen and improves skin firmness from within<br />
                    ✨ Visibly reduces cellulite and reshapes the silhouette<br />
                    ✨ Relaxing and painless treatment<br />
                    ✨ No surgery or downtime required<br />
                    ✨ Boosts lymphatic drainage and detoxification<br />
                    ✨ Can be combined with other body treatments (e.g., cavitation, pressotherapy, massage<br />
                </p>
                <h6>How Does It Work?</h6>
                <p>
                    A specialized RF device glides over the skin, delivering a pleasant warming sensation as radiofrequency waves penetrate into the deeper layers. This thermal stimulation activates fibroblasts to produce new collagen and elastin, which leads to smoother, tighter, and more toned skin.
                    The treatment is completely non-invasive, with no pain or recovery time. You can return to your daily routine right after.
                </p>
