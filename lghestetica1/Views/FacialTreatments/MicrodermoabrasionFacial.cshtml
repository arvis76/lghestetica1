                    <h6>What is Diamond Tip Microdermabrasion? </h6>
                    <p>
                        Diamond tip microdermabrasion is a deep exfoliation aesthetic treatment that uses a diamond-tipped applicator to remove dead skin cells, improve texture, and revitalize the complexion. This non-invasive procedure allows the skin to breathe again, leaving it feeling softer, fresher, and more radiant, with no downtime.
                        Through a controlled mechanical abrasion process, a gentle but effective exfoliation is performed that stimulates collagen production and enhances blood circulation in the treated area.

                    <h6>How does the treatment work?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Diamond tip microdermabrasion is performed using a specialized device with a fine diamond-coated tip. This tip gently exfoliates the outer layers of the skin while suctioning away impurities and dead skin cells. As the tip moves across the skin, a controlled exfoliation is done, improving texture and radiance.
                        The procedure is painless, requires no anesthesia, and most patients experience only a mild warmth or tingling sensation during the session. The treatment can be performed on the face, neck, décolletage, hands, and other areas of the body.
