                    <h6>What is Radiofrequency (RF) for the Face?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Facial radiofrequency (RF) treatment is a non-invasive skin tightening method that uses controlled heat energy to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin deep within the skin. The result is a firmer, smoother, and more youthful-looking complexion — all without needles, downtime, or surgery.
                        This treatment is ideal for those looking to lift sagging skin, reduce fine lines, or refresh dull, tired skin.

                    <h6>What Is Radiofrequency Used For?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Radiofrequency facial treatments are commonly used to improve:
                        ✅ Sagging skin (especially jawline, cheeks, and neck)
                        ✅ Fine lines and early wrinkles
                        ✅ Tired or dull-looking skin
                        ✅ Puffy under-eyes and dark circles
                        ✅ Poor facial contour or lack of definition
                        ✅ Enlarged pores and uneven skin texture
                        It’s also a popular preventive anti-aging treatment, helping to maintain firmness and skin health over time.

                    <h6>Key Benefits of Radiofrequency Treatment</h6>
                    <p>
                        ✨Stimulates natural collagen production – for firmer, plumper skin<br/>
                        ✨ Quick, pain-free, and relaxing – no needles, no downtime<br />
                        ✨ Feels like a warm facial massage – gentle and comfortable<br />
                        ✨ Improves skin texture and tone – smooths and refines<br />
                        ✨ Visible results after a few sessions – with continued improvement over time<br />
                        ✨ Safe for most skin types and tones<br />
                    </p>
                    <h6>What to Expect During Treatment</h6>
                    <p>
                        Each session typically lasts 30–45 minutes. A specialized RF device is gently glided over the skin, delivering radiofrequency waves that heat the deeper layers (dermis) without damaging the surface. This thermal effect stimulates the skin’s healing response, boosting collagen renewal and tightening the tissue naturally.
                        Most clients describe the sensation as a pleasant, warm feeling — no discomfort, no downtime.
